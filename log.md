# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 01st, 2018 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: 

1. Started an Android project (based on the book "Android Essencial com Kotlin"), it's a simple app, written in Kotlin, for displaying vintage cars;

2. Followed this cute little Git/GitHub tutorial (https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) to improve my version control skills;

**Thoughts:** I'm really struggling to focus and maintain productivity since I have ADHD (aka Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder). That's why I'm trying to keep track of my progress with daily posts.
